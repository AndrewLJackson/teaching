```{r setup}
library(tidyverse)
library(kableExtra) # for pretty table printing
library(broom)
```


```{r}

dd <- data.frame(x = 1:10, y = letters[1:10])

dd %>% 
  kable() %>%
  kable_styling(protect_latex = TRUE, full_width = FALSE)


```

inline maths doesn't work with the call to `kable_styling` e.g. $5x$

but standalone does

$$5x$$
