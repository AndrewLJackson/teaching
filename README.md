# teaching
This repository holds various files including presentations, and vignettes, workbooks, manuals etc.. that I use in my teaching. The vignettes are written in RMarkdown and produce standalone *.pdf or *.html files that you can share and work through. Many of the lectures are compiled using slidify, and produce richer *.html files that require the various folders containing the assets (style sheets, images, etc...) in order for you to view them. The best way to view these files on your local machine is to download this repository as a *.zip file or clone it if you are familiar with GitHub.

The folder `lectures/` contains the slidify produced `HTML5` files and folders.

These learning resources form part of various modules that I teach including:

## ZO4030 / BD7054 - Data Handling and Analysis

- `vignettes/logs/intro-to-logs.html` - A worksheet reminding us what logs are and what log transformations do to data.
- `lectures/log-log.html` - Log-log regression for modelling allometric and other scaling relationships.
